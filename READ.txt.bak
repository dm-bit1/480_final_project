The application found in the src folder satisfies the 17 requirements
outlined in the Project Description pdf file.
There are 2 files in the src folder 1. main.py 2. gui.py. 
The main.py connects to the database
and the gui.py has roughly 1,600 lines of Python code to handle the GUI.
A few notes about how the application was done and set up.
The database was made in MySQL Workbench using Windows 10.
The Python code requires the MySQL connector package to succesfully
connect to the database.
The GUI code used mostly the CustomTkinter library.
There is a comment with a link about how to use CustomTkinter in the gui.py file.
There is at least one function that handles each of the 17 required
functionalities for admin, nurse, patient user groups.
Note, the way the program is done, the patient and nurse must 
enter a char to MI (middle initial) field when prompted for input, because
there's a function that throws an exception for empty inputs.
The SQL folder contains the MySQL file that defines the entire project's schema 
called "hospital.sql" and the file I used to do test queries called "test_query.sql".
In reality, much of the testing was done by doing CRUD operations to the database
in Python using MySQL and checking the MySQL Workbench to see if the database changes worked properly. 
This workflow allowed for checking for bugs as well.
The exact software I used; Spyder IDE 5.4.3, Python 3.11.5 64-bit | Qt 5.15.2 | PyQt5 5.15.7 | Windows 10 
MySQL Workbench 8.0.34 64bit.
